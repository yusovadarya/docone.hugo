=== Documents
Now you can add files to documents: applications, specifications,  documents copies, etc. Adding and downloading files is available in the application, as well as through the API.

=== Templates
You can completely clear or copy the text style (font, size, color, weight, alignment and padding).

=== Transfering templates and documents
We have done a script to transfer templates and blocks to another instance. The system administrator can transfer data using the API.
