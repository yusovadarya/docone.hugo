=== Templates
==== Publication
We have fixed the Publish button in the template. Now, after publishing a template, it immediately becomes inactive.

The package is published immediately now, if you:
* copy it from the published package;
* create a package based on published templates, even if it contains several unpublished ones.

==== Conditions
Now, if you delete a part of a paragraph with an added condition, the condition itself is not deleted.

But if you add a page break to all the text under the condition, the condition will be removed.

The condition is now removed from the condition group in the sidebar if the —Åreation is canceled (Redo).

Now, when you select any content in the template, the Show Condition button is displayed in the sidebar.

==== Fields
Now, if in the headers and footers you delete a table cell and a field in it, the field will be removed from the list in the sidebar.
